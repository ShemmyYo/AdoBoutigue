## __Roll, Play, Win – Game On Board is Your Board Game Destination.__

GameOnBoard is a B2C (business-to-consumer) board game web store which aims to audiences, such as families, tabletop gamers, or collectors and specialising in strategic and role-playing board games. We have built a diverse and attractive inventory of board games, including popular titles such as …….. 

When designing GameOnBoard.ie page, I focused on creating a user-friendly, visually appealing e-commerce website with a responsive design and focused on implementing a secure and easy-to-navigate online shopping experience. One of my prorities was also to be able to optimise website for search engines (SEO) to improve organic visibility.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

This project was developed using agile methodologies by delivering small features (User Stories) across the project.

The Kanban board was created using Github projects and can be located [here](https://github.com/users/ShemmyYo/projects/6) and can be viewed to see more information on the project cards. 

Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and label user stories.
User Stories were assigned to Epics, prioritized under the labels:

- `MUST HAVE` - guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- `SHOULD HAVE` - adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- `COULD HAVE` - has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- `WON'T HAVE` - not a priority for this iteration

To ensure that all core requirements were completed I worked on the 'MUST HAVE' epics/user stories first.

A few `COULD HAVE` user stories have been implemented before project due date i.e. ...

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.


***
## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://shemmylicious.herokuapp.com).

***
### ElephantSQL Database

This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:
- Click **Create New Instance** to start a new database.
- Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: tribe).
- Select the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.
- You can leave the **Tags** blank.
- Select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

[Back to top &uarr;](#contents)

***
### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.
- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

### Heroku Deployment

[Setting up basic Django Project and Deploying to Heroku CI Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P5CWvS5cYalkQOLeQiijpSViDPogtKM7ZGyqK-yehhQ/edit)

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

1. Select *New* in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select *Create new app* from the dropdown menu.
1. Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select *Create App*.
1. Further down, to support dependencies, select *Add Buildpack*.
1. The order of the buildpacks is important, select `Python` first, then `Node.js` second. (if they are not in this order, you can drag them to rearrange them)
1. From the new app *Settings*, click *Reveal Config Vars*, and set your environment variables.

    
    - CLOUNDINARY_URL: (Enter Cloudinary API URL)
    - DATABASE_URL: (Enter the database URL from ElephantSQL)
    - PORT: 8000
    - DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC: 1 (must be removed before final deployment)
    - SECRET_KEY: (Enter your secret key)

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's *requirements* (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The *Procfile* can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace *app_name* with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select *Automatic Deployment* from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a <app_name>` (replace app_name with your app, without the angle-brackets)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

***
### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "insert your own Cloudinary API key here")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "insert your own ElephantSQL database URL here")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "this can be any random secret key")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`
